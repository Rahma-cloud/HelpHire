# HelpHire

## Oveerview

HelpHire is a digital marketplace where people in need of domestic help can connect with trusted and vetted professional service providers to get everyday household chores done. It’s like Uber, but for local and domestic services such as cleaning, plumbing, laundry, childcare, and cooking.

## What HelpHire Does

With HelpHire, registered users (clients) can easily discover available services near them and browse through profiles of providers that meet their needs. They can book professionals, pay securely (with escrow services available), chat in real time, and get their work done without hassle.
Service providers can register and get vetted to become available for jobs around their location. They can manage their availability, accept bookings, and receive payment once their work is verified. The platform admin ensures smooth operations and satisfaction for both clients and providers.
It also has a two-way review system where both parties can rate and review each other after a service is completed.

## Why It matters

Getting reliable and professional domestic help can be stressful, risky, and time consuming, especially for people who are new to an area. People mostly rely on words of mouth and some other connections that does not really guarantee quality and efficient service delivery.
HelpHire makes the process seamless by connecting users with vetted and skillful helpers they can trust. It gives people peace of mind, saves time, and empowers service providers with better access to clients.
Everyone deserves reliable help when life gets busy. HelpHire bridges the gap between those who need assistance and those willing to provide it efficiently, creating safer and more dependable connections within the community they both serve.
